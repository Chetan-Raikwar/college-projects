On-Screen keyboard with enhanced features :D

This is an on-screen keyboard built using JAVA for my college project. So what it does, is :-

	1. You can type your text and transfer it directly to system clipboard, ready to be pasted.

	2. The text placed in system clipboard will be automatically erased after 10 seconds.

	3. No need to interact with keyboard, just click the buttons on GUI.

	4. SHUFFLER ON : each time you click a button, entire keymap is shuffled, 
	   making it harder to memorize the keypress by the one staring at your screen.

	5. Secret text can be typed by keeping the characters hidden.

System Requirements :-
	
	1. System having JDK 1.7+ installed.
	2. Mouse.
	3. Adequate configuration with respect to JDK mentioned above.
